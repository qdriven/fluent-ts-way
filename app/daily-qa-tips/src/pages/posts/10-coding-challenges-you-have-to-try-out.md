Yesterday I gave you [five reasons why I love coding challenges](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/5-reasons-why-i-love-coding-challenges/), and why you should give them a try.

However, we didn't really dive into finding these coding challenges.

In this article, I'll help you find coding challenges to start solving them.

## Dare2Compete

Packed with many career benefits, Dare2Compete, famously known as D2C, is a go-to platform for coding challenges and [hackathons](https://dare2compete.com/hackathons). Put your tech skills to use at hackathons conducted at D2C by Accenture, Walmart, Juspay, Myntra, Flipkart, AB InBev, TVS Credit, Uber, Amazon, Optum, and other companies. The icing on the cake is that many coders even land coveted jobs from participating in such hackathons.

So go with an open mind, explore their broad spectrum of online and virtual coding challenges across domains like algorithmic, data structures, data science, machine learning, etc., and youâ€™ll always end up learning something at D2C!

## FreeCodeCamp challenges

FreeCodeCamp is not only a super good resource for people wanting to level up their development game.
They also provided real-world and very in-depth coding challenges for you to solve.

The great thing about FreeCodeCamp is that they do not focus on one area. You can choose different languages to try out.

## LeetCode

Another immense resource of coding challenges is LeetCode. They provide free and premium challenges you can complete.

The cool part here is that they also include questions asked at some of the bigger tech companies.

They also divided the challenges into categories, so you can really pick a challenge related to your skill level.

## TopCoder

![TopCoder logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579533795/we8ZQZNKP.png)

TopCoder is a real community treasure. It's full of eager people to solve challenges and talk about the solutions.

They also provide paid challenges, where you can get paid for solving a problem.

This is a really cool space to check out, and especially to compare other solutions from the community.

## CoderByte

![CoderByte logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579564929/0xuWC9Sjq.png)

CoderByte is a really cool platform because it has put a lot of detail into the challenges. You can choose which language you would like to solve a specific challenge.

And the cool part to me is that you can see other people's solutions.
This way, you can learn and improve even more.
They even provide video solutions for some of the challenges.

## Edabit

![EdaBit logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579594556/hQDf-FMz0.png)

Edabit is a really great source for beginners; it offers a lot of easy to get started with challenges.

And once you master these beginner ones, you can advance to some more advanced queries there.

You can also track your own level and grow on their ranking list.

## Codewars

![Codewars logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579645725/YGlAqOpcF.png)

Personally, I really love Codewars because it includes many community made challenges.

This will give you a lot of different challenges ranging from easy to very hard.

They also provide a lot of different languages you can try out.
And if you are stuck or looking for a review on your solution, they offer a great way to discuss the challenge.

## HackerRank

![HackerRank logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579679857/0L5QC4aKd.jpeg)

This is a very well-known interview prepping coding challenge platform.
It's been used a lot by people preparing for tech interviews. It includes a lot of data structure and algorithm challenges.

They also have sets of challenges you can complete during x number of days, which is a fun way to do them.

They also have a fantastic discussion panel where people share their answers and see their thinking around a solution.

## CodeChef

![CodeChef logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579751569/tYA0cVSAI.jpeg)

CodeChef has a super large community around it, which makes it great if you really want to find the best solution.

They also provide monthly challenges where they post a video explanation at the end.

And they even have a problem of the day.
You can also opt to solve challenges with a mentor if you are on the novice coding side.

## CodePen

![CodePen logo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640579785389/ChlK2d7ut.png)

CodePen is widely known to be a really cool system where you can mainly set up pens, which are try-out demo code editors.

Many people use these to showcase some HTML/JavaScript to other people.

And they do offer great monthly challenges if you are interested in the more UI kind of challenges.

They offer themed challenges, a super fun way to level up your skills.

## Bonus

There are often small challenges that emerge for a short amount of time.

Think about Hackathons, Advent coding challenges, or company set challenges.

I did not mention these in the main article as they often are only valid for the short term, but they are worth keeping an eye out for.

They often even allow you to collaborate with other people and are larger in the setup, so you can really test your game.

I'm not a designer, not by a long shot. So when it comes to design, I need a lot of inspiration.

For the redesign, I researched and wanted to find a cool color scheme for my website.

In my journey, I found these five unique websites for **color schemes**, ready for you to use:

1. [Coolors](#heading-1.-coolors)
2. [Colours cafe](#heading-2.-colours-cafe)
3. [Dribbble](#heading-3.-dribbble)
4. [Pinterest](#heading-4.-pinterest)
5. [Colormind](#heading-5.-colormind)

## 1. Coolors

My go-to color scheme website must be coolors. It's a cool website and super simple to use.
The schemes are top-notch, and you can even search based on colors!

## 2. Colours cafe

I found this one doing my research and dig the schemes on there. The website is still under construction but pretty cool to view. Already press down with your mouse for a cool gimmick!

## 3. Dribbble

Dribbble is a well-known design collective and not a color scheme website, yet it can be used like one.

There are multiple ways of exploring dribbble;

- Search for color schemes: [Result of color schemes](https://dribbble.com/search/color%20scheme)
  This method gives you either some designed or just websites with good schemes.

- Search based on color: [Result of pink](https://dribbble.com/search?color=E8308C)
  This will give you all designs with a specific color in them. It might spark some secondary color ideas.

## 4. Pinterest

Pinterest can be similar to dribbble, and what you'll find might surprise you.

I like to start with a search query like [color scheme](https://nl.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=color%20scheme&rs=typed&term_meta[]=color%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=scheme%7Ctyped). This will give you some paint examples, as well as online schemes.

## 5. Colormind

Colormind is a super cool generator that uses deep learning to improve your schemes.

It's super cool for websites since it can help you decide which element should have a specific color.

It can also help to optimize your images for specific colors.

Usually, I'm not one to jump on the hype train of new tooling and frameworks. However, Astro sparked my interest.

In its most basic form, it's a framework to build websites.
However, it turns out to be a bit more than that!

The team behind Astro took inspiration from the biggest open source projects around and used their principles in Astro.

## Why Astro is so great

- Full HTML output, no JavaScript unless you need it, and even that comes with options!
- SEO focused, sitemap integrated, RSS feed is done, pagination and collections
- BYOF approach, choose whatever framework you are comfy with React, Svelte, Vue, or none of those ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- Components that will turn into static HTML

This makes it like the super combination between an interactive component library like React and a static site generator like Eleventy.

Astro also comes with its files called `.astro` files. They are very much like `.jsx` files!
There are some minor differences on which Astro provides an [excellent comparison table](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/astro-components#comparing-astro-versus-jsx).

But of course, the main reason why Astro is so great:

**Performance**

No crazy reason behind it is so good on the speed index. It's a natural cause of having a fully static HTML output.
And I love it.

Of course, Eleventy is also pure HTML output, but not having JavaScript components we can easily reuse.

## Getting started with Astro

The best way to get started with any framework or tool is to give it a try.

So let's go ahead and give Astro a run.
The installation is as easy as it gets.

```bash
# Create folder and navigate to it
mkdir astro-website
cd astro-website

# Init astro project
npm init astro
# Install all dependencies
npm install
# Start Astro!
npm start
```

> Note: The Astro init gives you super cool options for which template and framework to use!

## Data fetching in Astro

Let's look at building a super simple website that will fetch some data from an external API and render some card components.

We'll use the [Anime API](https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#) for today's article, and I choose the `top` endpoint.

Let's define that on the top of our index.astro file.

```jsx
---
import Card from '../components/Card.astro'
const remoteData = await fetch('https://api.jikan.moe/v3/top/anime/1').then(response => response.json());
---
```

Then we want to create a card with the following data from each result:

- Title
- Image
- Episodes
- Score
- Href (To link)

Let's go ahead and map all our data objects to cards.

```html
<main class="grid">
  {remoteData.top.map((item) =>
  <Card
    title="{item.title}"
    score="{item.score}"
    episodes="{item.episodes}"
    href="{item.url}"
    image="{item.image_url}"
  />)}
</main>
```

You can see we added the grid class on the main element, and a cool thing we can do is add a style element.
I've defined the language as SCSS so it can compile correctly.

```html
<style lang="scss">
  .grid {
    margin: 4rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    @media (max-width: 650px) {
      grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
      margin: 2rem;
    }
    gap: 3rem;
  }
</style>
```

Now let's see how this would look at how this Card component looks.

Create a new file called `Card.astro` in the `components` library.

```jsx
---
export interface Props {
  title: string;
  image: string;
  episodes: number;
  score: float;
  href: string
}

const { title, image, episodes, score, href  } = Astro.props;
---
<article>
    <img src={image} alt={title} />
    <div class="content">
        <a href={href}><h2>{title}</h2></a>
        <p>üì∫ Episodes: {episodes}</p>
        <p>‚≠êÔ∏è Rating: {score}</p>
    </div>
</article>

<style>
    article {
        line-height: 1.5;
        background: #fff;
        border-radius: 8px;
        color: #333;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
    img {
        max-height: 290px;
        width: 100%;
        -o-object-fit: cover;
        object-fit: cover;
    }
    .content {
        padding: 1rem;
    }
    h2 {
        font-size: 1rem;
        margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    }
    ul {
        list-style: none;
    }
</style>
```

I find this approach super satisfying. We can simply pass data to our component, so it's reusable.

And the component itself is nicely built of a definition part between the three lines `---` that includes our actual code.

Then we have a section with HTML where we bind the variables.

And at the bottom, we have a style element to add some basic card styling.

This will result in the following.

It's been an eventful series looking back at all these [A11Y articles](https://daily-dev-tips.com/tags/accessibility/).

I've already learned so much and feel like I only touched base on some of the basic stuff.

For now, I don't have any articles planned around accessibility, but I'm writing down ideas for a follow-up session.

## My question for you

What are some topics around accessibility you'd like to see covered?

With this question, some of my ideas involve looking at websites out there and seeing where they lack.

Audit guide forms nothing to being accessible.

And in-depth elements that we'll create together.

## Key takeaways

When it comes to accessibility, there is never a concrete answer.
From what I've picked up, there are always several correct ways of doing something, and each will have its pros and cons.

The most critical learning part for me is to use my website as someone with a disability. This showed me where it's lacking.

Another important takeaway is that disability doesn't mean a permanent thing, I didn't realize before starting this journey it's everyone, but situational disabilities are such a big thing.

- A parent holding a baby in one arm
- A super loud environment so people can't hear audio
- Bright sunlight for someone working outside in the sun
- And so on

## What do I expect

Since this was only a first step into accessibility, I expect it to become more intertwined in future writings.

I also hope to add some aspects of this back into my projects and thus will be able to write about it in more detail.

As the reader, I hope you learned some things, and please do let me know what your main takeaway is so far and what you'd like to see covered in this field.

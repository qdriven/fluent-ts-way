I'm glad I sparked your interest because Reply is hosting a coding challenge!

And you know that [I love a good coding challenge](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/5-reasons-why-i-love-coding-challenges/).

This will be the 5th time they are hosting this challenge, and it's a big thing in the developer space.

Not because it's always good fun to participate in coding challenges, but because this challenge allows you to participate in teams of 2-4 people.

How cool is it if you and your friends can participate in a challenge together and even win excellent prizes?

This particular challenge is split up into two categories to serve everyone's needs:

1. Standard edition
2. Teen edition

Let's look into more detail what each one entails too.

## The Reply Standard Edition coding challenge

This is the main challenge open to students and professional coders as long as you are over 16 years old.

The competition will be hosted online on the [challenges.reply.com](https://replychallenges.com/9zj) website.

The challenge will take place on the 10th of March, where you and your team of 2-4 members will get four hours to complete the coding challenge.

The cool part is you can choose in which language you want to code the challenge!

Don't have a team in mind?
Don't worry. You can either come up with your own team or join an existing team that is waiting for participants.
They even provide a [Telegram group](https://replychallenges.com/FindYourTeamMate) for finding teammates. 

I hope you are already hyped for this fantastic challenge?
Now let me tell you about the prizes (each team member will get):

1. MacBook Pro 16"
2. Oculus Quest 2
3. Apple Air-pods Pro

## The Reply Teen Edition coding challenge

The teen edition is specifically designed for students ages 14-19 years old.

In this challenge, you must solve mathematical problems in any coding language.

This particular challenge is designed for students to win money for their school. Your school stands a chance to win up to â‚¬5000 in coding courses!

Like the standard edition, you will have to develop a team of 2-4 people.
Don't worry if you don't have a team. You can always join a random team last minute.

## How will it work?

Both challenges will be held on the 10th of March, from 16.30 CET to 20.30 CET.

You have to solve the coding challenges in the reply online environment during this time.
You can pick any coding language you would like to solve these challenges in.

You can choose any form of communication to chat with your team. Of course, it would be fun if you could meet up in person, but if you are across the world, you can use any online tool.

## How to practice?

Are you feeling a bit rusty? Or perhaps want to be well prepared to take home those fantastic prices?

Reply offers a [training program](https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/coding#training) for you to participate in. This program consists of actual assignments from the previous years. This means you will get a good understanding of the problems thrown at you and your team.

If that isn't enough, there are many [code challenge websites](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/10-coding-challenges-you-have-to-try-out/) that you can try out to learn.

## Conclusion

It's free, you can win fabulous prizes, and best of all you can have a lot of fun solving these challenges with your friends!

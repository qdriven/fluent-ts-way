As you might know by now, I like Bash!

So far, we have built some fun stuff using Bash like [hacking our morning routine](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/ive-automated-my-morning-routine/) and making an [after work git check](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/bash-never-forget-to-git-commit-again/).

I use [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) to generate these cool previews for many of my articles.
Very cool app, but my Downloads folder gets full of these things.

So how can Bash help us CleanOurMacs?

## Bash clean files

> Note: This script can be very dangerous since it uses Bash to remove files. Please be cautious!

We will use a `txt` file to loop over files we want to remove.

These files can include a wildcard (\*) or start with a specific string:

- Start with: `carbon`
- Wildcard: `carbon*.png`

Then on to the script!

```bash
while read line; do
    find . -name "$line" -exec rm -rf {} \;
done < ~/www/cleanMyPc/files.txt
echo 'All done';
```

Wow, simple as that, right?

We loop through the lines in our `files.txt`, and for each line, we execute the `find` command. It searches for a specific name and calls `-exec rm -rf`

The `rm` stands for `remove` and `rf` for `recursive force`.

## Running the script

This script initially worked so it would scan all your files, but I adjusted it for security reasons to only scan a specific folder.

1. So open a Terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you want: `cd Downloads`
3. Execute command `~/path/to/script/bash.sh`
4. Voila, all done

It's a straightforward script, but it can be helpful to find/remove specific files on your computer.

Today I want to make a slightly different approach; I see many new aspiring developers struggle with the same question: How do I become a good developer?

They ask what languages they should learn. When should they learn what? And how fast it will go.

There is not a one size fits all, but I hope to give my 10 cents about this topic.

## Basic development path

My recommendation for a path to follow would be the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Now Stop learning and start creating
- SASS
- Advance JS -> React/Angular/Vue/Whatever is hip

So my main thing is, don't overdo yourself. When learning to become a developer, it's so essential your basis is perfect!

You can be a React Star, and that's perfect, but if you don't understand HTML, you will have such a disadvantage.

## Must I become a front & back-end developer?

That is one question I've seen many times, and it's tough to answer. It depends on what makes you happy. I started as a front-end developer; I had no clue what back-end meant and didn't like it. Nowadays, I'm considered a full-stack developer, but I like the back-end part way more.
I found it to come naturally to me.

## So, How do I become a good developer?

The main tip here is: "Start developing things!". Yes, easy said, but ok, let's say you only know HTML/CSS. You can build basic websites. Take a website you like and rebuild it!
Now at one stage, you know JavaScript, find yourself a challenging subject, and again recreate it.

Even better, invent your project. Find something that inspires you like movies/sports/animals and create an interactive web experience with that.

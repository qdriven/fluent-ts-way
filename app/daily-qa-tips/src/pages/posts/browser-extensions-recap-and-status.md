I started the browser extension series to explore and learn more about how to set up different browser extensions.

I learned so much from all the articles in this series.
And I even submitted a browser extension to the Chrome store.

## Status

As for now, I want to stop the beginner series for the extensions and see how people find it.

I'd love to hear from you if you learned something new and if you would like me to dive into a particular topic.

Also, let me know if you completely missed something in this series that you think I should try and cover.

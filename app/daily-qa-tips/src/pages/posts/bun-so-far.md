I must say I'm impressed with Bun. However, as expected, they are still working on many things underwater.

This means I'll put Bun on a side track for now.
I'll keep playing with it, especially once some roadmap items are released.

## What works in Bun

The speed is incredible, from the basic start to the Next and React image. It's just super fast!

I also appreciate their Discord community, where everyone seems super happy to help you.

I'm also pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to set up a basic React and Next application on Bun.

## So what's the catch

As mentioned, I think it's a bit early to adopt it fully. There seem to be some essential things missing for me, at least.

This includes a solid router (there are some out there, but I rather wait a bit for a stable one).
But also, from the Next starter, I hit some things that should work, including the SSR.

After asking around on Discord, this should be supported already, so I will keep trying to set it up and let you all know once I get it to work.

As for me, I will keep an eye out for upcoming Bun things and keep you posted via these articles as I try them out.

I'd love to hear if you were able to give Bun a test run and what you've built with it.

Did you know Chrome developer console comes with a whole hidden Command menu?

I didn't know until a while ago, and it comes packed with fantastic features.

Today we are looking into making a screenshot of a specific element with it.

## How to Screenshot a specific element

- Inspect the element you wish to screenshot
- Press Cmd + Shift + P | Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command menu
- Type `Screenshot` within the menu
- Select the `Capture node screenshot` to capture the selected element.

I hope you are as excited about this hidden menu as I am.

Now that we know how to use an existing service in our routes. Let's take it to. The next level and see how we can create our service even.

A service is something that you can use throughout your application.

Let's say we want to add a translation service, for instance.
We'll have to open up our medusa server project and create a new file inside the `src/services`.

If our service is the `translateService`, we should name the file `translate.js` (filename without the Service part).

## Creating a service in medusa

The most basic service file would look like this.

```js
import { TransactionBaseService } from '@medusajs/medusa';

class TranslateService extends TransactionBaseService {
  func() {
    return '';
  }
}

export default TranslateService;
```

As you can see, the service extends the `â€ŒTransactionBaseService`, which gives us access to all the existing and other services.

Let's create a mock demo function so that we can give it a try.
With translations, we would need some mapping table, but let's mock it out for now.

```js
const messages = {
  en: {
    title: 'Hello world',
  },
  nl: {
    title: 'Hallo wereld',
  },
};

class TranslateService extends TransactionBaseService {
  translate(msg, locale) {
    return messages[locale][msg] ?? msg;
  }
}
```

This translate function will be able to translate specific messages into provided locales. If there is no match, the original message will be returned.

## Using the custom service

Let's go ahead and see how we can use this custom service.
I'll use it in our [custom routes](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/using-services-in-custom-medusa-routes/) as we already had a good intro.

Let's add a new route that will get our title.

```js
router.get('/store/title', (req, res) => {
  const translateService = req.scope.resolve('translateService');
  const title = translateService.translate('title', 'en');
  res.json({ title });
});
```

The first thing we do is retrieve our translate service, then we define a new variable for the title and request the title in a specific locale.
And eventually, return that.

Spool up your server and test out the route.

Now let's change the locale to `nl` and try it again.

```js
const title = translateService.translate('title', 'nl');
```

And you can even try to request a message that doesn't have any translations.

```js
const title = translateService.translate('Products', 'en');
```

And that's it. We now have a fully functional custom service in medusa.

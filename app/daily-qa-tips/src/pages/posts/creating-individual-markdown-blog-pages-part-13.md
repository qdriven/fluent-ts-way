In the previous article, we changed our [blog post to be loaded from local markdown files](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/loading-local-markdown-blog-posts-part-12/).

With that in place, we can start creating individual markdown-powered blog posts!

If you want to follow this article, use the [following branch](https://github.com/rebelchris/next-portfolio/tree/part-12) as your starting point.

## Creating individual blog pages

In the blog overview, we set the URL to individual pages as `/blog/${slug}`, where the slug would be the file's name.

We can start by creating a dynamic page in our `blog` pages directory.
We can call this file `[slug].js`. This dynamic format in Next.js allows random slugs to be valid files.

This file will need to use both the `getStaticPaths` and the `getStaticProps` functions. This is what they do:

- `getStaticPaths`: Create all possible slug options for each post
- `getStaticProps`: Get the actively requested page with more details for this specific article

So the first one is to generate all the available blog posts as a valid option, and the second is to fetch the details for this blog.

The structure of the file will look like this:

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {}

export async function getStaticProps({ params: { slug } }) {}

export default function PostPage({ frontmatter, content }) {}
```

Let's start by creating the static paths function.

```js
import fs from 'fs';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const files = fs.readdirSync('./posts');

  const paths = files.map((fileName) => ({
    params: {
      slug: fileName.replace('.md', ''),
    },
  }));
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

As with the blog overview page, we need to read all our files from the posts directory.
We then map them with their filenames, which means a path with the slug will be valid for each file.

With the individual request, we need to extract both the frontmatter parts and the page's actual content.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export async function getStaticProps({ params: { slug } }) {
  const fileName = fs.readFileSync(`./posts/${slug}.md`, 'utf-8');
  const { data: frontmatter, content } = matter(fileName);
  return {
    props: {
      frontmatter,
      content,
    },
  };
}
```

Now we can adjust our render function to return the content for the requested file.

```js
export default function PostPage({ frontmatter, content }) {
  return (
    <section className='px-6'>
      <div className='max-w-4xl mx-auto py-12'>
        <div className='prose mx-auto'>
          <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
          <div>{content}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Let's take a look at how this renders now.

So it looks like everything is there, but we see two issues.

- The markdown is not rendering as HTML
- The page doesn't apply any styling

For the first part, we can leverage a pretty cool NPM package that will convert markdown into HTML.

Start by installing the package.

```bash
npm install markdown-it
```

Now import this package on the `[slug].js` page and set the content to render.

```js
import md from 'markdown-it';

export default function PostPage({ frontmatter, content }) {
  return (
    <section className='px-6'>
      <div className='max-w-4xl mx-auto py-12'>
        <div className='prose mx-auto'>
          <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: md().render(content) }} />
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

We have to use the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function. However, since we own the content on the server, this is safe enough.

If now refresh, we can see the `#` is rendering as a heading, but it still all looks the same.

And luckily for us, there is a Tailwind plugin to handle auto styling for us. This means we don't have to go and add classes to each element.

Install the plugin first:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then open the `tailwind.config.js` file and add the plugin:

```js
plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')];
```

Restart the server and open the page again!
You should now see a styled website, go ahead and add some markdown to the page to see it work.

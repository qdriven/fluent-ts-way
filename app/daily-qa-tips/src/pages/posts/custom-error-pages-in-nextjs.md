There is always that moment a user ends up on a page that doesn't exist.
So let's see how we can make these pages stand out more by adding our pages for each error page.

## Creating a 404 page in Next.js

Let's start with the most common one, the 404 page. This one often occurs if the users end up on a page that no longer exists or make a typo in the URL.

Let's try to find a random page called `/does-not-exist` and see what happens:

![Slug error in Next.js](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632462057881/xoaBSN9te.png)

So we get the above error because we said fallback is true for the `getStaticPaths` function.

That means it should always try to resolve the page even if it can't find the static props.

To fix this, we can set the fallback to false like this, which will redirect to a 404 if it can't resolve.

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const pagesWithSlugs = await getAllPagesWithSlugs();
  return {
    paths: pagesWithSlugs.edges.map(({node}) => `/${node.slug}`) || [],
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

To create the 404 page, we can create a page called `404.js` in our `pages` directory.

```js
export default function Custom404() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen mx-2 my-2 overflow-hidden ">
      <div className="px-6 py-4 rounded shadow-lg">
        <div className="mb-2 text-xl font-bold">
          404 - Sorry could not find this page ðŸ˜…
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And now, when reloading the page, we should see the following page.

![Next.js 404 page](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632462239412/AgqVVYFma.png)

## 500 error page in Next.js

Sometimes there might be something else wrong, and our website might throw a 500 error.

We can create a custom error page for those pages as well.
Create a file called `500.js` in your `pages` directory.

```js
export default function Custom500() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen mx-2 my-2 overflow-hidden ">
      <div className="px-6 py-4 rounded shadow-lg">
        <div className="mb-2 text-xl font-bold">500 - Server error ðŸ˜­</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is the basic approach to having custom error pages in Next.js.

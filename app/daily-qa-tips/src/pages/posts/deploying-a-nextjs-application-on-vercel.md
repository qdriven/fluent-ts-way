Seeing that the fantastic creators of Next.js created Vercel, it's the smartest choice to go with Vercel as your Next hosting.

They make the process super easy!

## Deploying a Next.js application on Vercel

To get started deploying your app on Vercel, follow along with these steps:

1. Visit the [Vercel website and sign up](https://vercel.com/signup) (I used GitHub as the provider)
2. From the import project, choose your GitHub project
3. Since it's a Next.js project, everything will be set correctly. We have to choose a team and click the deploy button
4. Visit your project online ðŸŽ‰

You can find my deployed version here:

[Next Tailwind project on Vercel](https://next-tailwind-lake.vercel.app/)

And that's how easy it can be!
Even on other hosts like [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) the process is quite similar and easy to follow.

First of all, HAPPY NEW YEAR!

It's been such a crazy year for this 2020 thing...
I can't even believe it's finally done, but I have a feeling this mayhem is not done.

So let's start the year on a positive note. I found another cool thing in Firefox dev tools, the animation debugger.

It's amazing! It can modify, debug, and timeframe animations.

The tool looks like this:

## Firefox animation debug tool

To find the animation tool we have to open the developer tools:

- **Mac**: `Shift` + `âŒ˜` + `J`
- **Windows/Linux**: `Shift` + `CTRL` + `J`

Then we can inspect an element on the page that has an animation. And open the Animation tab.

On the left, you see the animation in the Keyframe animation. In my case, it converts a square to a round div in three steps.

You can use the keyframe section to make modifications to each keyframe.

Then on the right, you will see how long the whole animation takes in the purple bar, in my case, 2000ms (2s).

And in the bottom bit, we see the animation flow. I use an ease-in-out, so it's a smooth line.

Then on top, we can control the animation to debug it. We can go back to step 0, pause/play, and set the speed.

All and all, it's a super helpful tool to debug and work on your animations.

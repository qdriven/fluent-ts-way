My confession: I've never used canvas before this article.
I have a fantastic idea in my head, which needs Canvas, so why not document my explorations using the `HTML` canvas element?

`<canvas>` is an `HTML` element used to draw graphics via `JavaScript`.

It can do quite a lot of cool things, including;

- Draw shapes
- Animations
- Combine photos
- User drawings

Today, we'll get started by exploring some of it's basic options.

It will look like this:

## Creating our first HTML Canvas

To create our first canvas, we don't need to do much:

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

This will create a default canvas element, which is 300x150 pixels. We can set the width and height on a canvas element or style it via `CSS`.

It doesn't look like much since we haven't rendered anything on it.

## Creating our first shape on the HTML Canvas

We need to use JavaScript to get our canvas element to add our first shape.

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
```

Now we have our basic canvas element. We need to specify its context:

```js
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

> We can also get the 3D Engine, but that's for a later article.

Ok, let's add a square, maybe?

```js
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
```

We are sending the parameters (x, y, width, height).

Cool, so now we see our first rectangle!

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="rebelchris" data-slug-hash="RwayBVW" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Getting started with the HTML canvas">

## Other shapes

There are quite a lot of shapes we can make with the Canvas;

- Rectangles
- Paths
- Arcs
- Curves (Quadratic & Bezier)

With that, we can create any shape. Here are some examples:

### Canvas Circle

```js
// Cirlce
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(100, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
```

The parameters for arc are (x, y, Radius, startingAngle, endAngle)

### Canvas Triangle

```js
// Triangle
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(200, 75);
ctx.lineTo(100, 75);
ctx.lineTo(100, 25);
ctx.fill();
```

As for the move, the argument accepts the (x, y) coordinates.
And the lineTo (x, y) from where ever the moveTo is set.

### Canvas Heart

```js
// Hearth
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(75, 40);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(75, 37, 70, 25, 50, 25);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(20, 25, 20, 62.5, 20, 62.5);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(20, 80, 40, 102, 75, 120);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(110, 102, 130, 80, 130, 62.5);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(130, 62.5, 130, 25, 100, 25);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(85, 25, 75, 37, 75, 40);
ctx.stroke();
```

The bezierCurveTo accepts (x of control point 1, y of control point 1, x of control point 2, y of control point 2, x ending, y ending)

Find these on the following Codepen.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="rebelchris" data-slug-hash="RwaJVbM" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Getting started with the HTML canvas - Shapes">

## Browser Support

The canvas element is well supported these days and is defiantly a good option if you want to draw vectors on screen.

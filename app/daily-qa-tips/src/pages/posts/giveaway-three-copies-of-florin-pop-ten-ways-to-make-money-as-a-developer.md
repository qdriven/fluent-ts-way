First of all!

Merry Christmas everyone! 🎄

To me, Christmas is all about giving back, and I consider myself quite fortunate to have a job during these crazy times.

So what better way to give back to the community than to give you the ultimate resource on how to make money as a developer.

[Florin Pop](https://twitter.com/florinpop1705) is an absolute legendary developer, whom I respect massively.

He launched his e-book ["Ten++ Ways to Make Money as a Developer"](https://gumroad.com/l/makemoneydev/launchtwitter) eBook.

It's an amazing resource on how you can turn yourself into a business.

I'm not giving away just one copy, not just two, but three copies!

All you have to do is fill out this 3 question form!

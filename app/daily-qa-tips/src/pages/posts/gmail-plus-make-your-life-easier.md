3.9 billion users. Yes, Gmail is massive and has a lot of cool features.

Today we will look at the Gmail + plus action to make your life easier!

Nowadays, we get so much email, and it gets cluttered quickly.

## Gmail + email address

In Gmail, you get a specific email address. Let's say:

`info@daily-dev-tips.com` or `chrisbongers@gmail.com`

You can also use a plus to receive certain emails:

`info+social@daily-dev-tips.com` or `chrisbongers+spam@gmail.com`

These will arrive in your regular mailbox!

That is already very cool. You can use it to sign into one service with the same address (Twitter personal + business)

But we are using it to put emails in specific categories!

## Gmail + sign filter

First, go to the filter section and add a new filter:

1. Settings
2. Filters and Blocked Addresses
3. Create a new Filter

Within this filter, type the email address in the `To` field.

Hit the `Create filter` button

Then we can set up our filter however we like. In my case, I'm only sending these emails to a specific category, but you could also mark them as read, for instance.

That's it! Emails send to `info+social@daily-dev-tips.com` will now end up in my Social category.

Have fun, and create some amazing filters to make your life easier! ðŸ˜™

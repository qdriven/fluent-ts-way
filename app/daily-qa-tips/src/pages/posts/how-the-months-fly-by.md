If you are anything like me, it seems time has been standing still since this covid thing started.

Looking at the date, it says March 1st, 2022.
However, it doesn't even feel like that.
Two whole months have already gone by?

What happened, it feels like I haven't even done anything this year, and by the time December comes, it will even be worse.

## Time is relative

Don't get stuck on this time issue. There will never be enough time in the day to do everything we want.

And the funny time about time is that it works both ways, it might look like it's flying, and sometimes it is.
But now try and take a step back, look at the bigger picture, a year, the last two years.

How much have you grown?

A lot, right?

And so time becomes relative. It works against us and with us.
Depending on which side we want to see.

## Focus on the good

Don't let time get the better of you.

I stopped wearing a watch because I felt consumed by the time. I was always under pressure to do stuff in less time, quicker, be somewhere in time, etc.

Once you realize you can only do a certain amount of things in a day, you can relax by not focusing as much on time.

I'll even tell you a bit about who I used to be, someone who barely slept 4 hours a day because there was too much work.

And I'll tell you a secret: It does not work!

You take away productivity by taking away from your sleep, relaxing time, and time with friends and family.

When I started sleeping 8/9 hours daily, my working time was shorter but more productive.
I could get more done in less time...

And that's when I realized we get a short amount of time to do stuff, so focus on the good.

Focus on doing things that make you better and enjoy doing.

By doing this, you will enjoy life to its fullest and never fret about time again.

## Time will still fly

Don't get me wrong, it will still feel like time is flying away from you, but at least by doing things you enjoy, you'll have no regrets about how you spend that time.

A perfect exercise here is to ask yourself just one thing:

What would you tell yourself a year ago if you could travel through time?

...

Take some time to think about that.
Often you'll end up saying things like: You shouldn't have...

This makes sense because you want to advise on how you could have done things better.

But perhaps you are at a level where you can say, well done. You'll genuinely enjoy life.

That's where we want to be, and by using this assignment, you'll be able to get to that point.

But it will take time, time that flies.

I hope you enjoyed this "a little bit weird" article, which sparked my mind.

I'd love to get your opinion on this, so let me know how you find time and what you've done to improve it.

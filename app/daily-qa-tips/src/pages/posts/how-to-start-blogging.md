It doesn't matter if you're into knitting, sports, or development-related topics. Blogging can be for everyone.

That being said: As long as you like it.
It's not much use if you don't like doing it.

In today's article, I want to address some steps to start your blog, and they are super easy to follow!

1. [Define a commitment](#heading-1.-define-a-commitment)
2. [Create a backlog](#heading-2.-create-a-backlog)
3. [Make it easy for yourself](#heading-3.-make-it-easy-for-yourself)
4. [Promote your blog](#heading-4.-promote-your-blog)
5. [Learn by doing](#heading-5.-learn-by-doing)

## 1. Define a commitment

With this point, I don't mean you have to write daily as I do.
But it's all about commitment. Your future readers like stability. It can be daily, weekly, monthly, or even once a quarter. Just make sure it's something you can keep up with.

With that being said, don't be overcompetitive in the beginning. You might already have your first 5 articles ready and think, oh cool, I can start every day.
Sometimes it's just best to pace yourself. Think about how it will go after that initial period.

## 2. Create a backlog

The second most important thing is creating a backlog.
As many know, I do try to write ahead of time.
As we speak, I'm writing this article 4 days in advance, which isn't a lot.

You have to consider days you can't write because of some party, birthday, or work issue.

Or, in my case, weekends away.

A backlog doesn't have to contain all finished articles, although that is the best.

It can contain drafts for you to look into later, but when you have some spare time, try to write a beginning to an article.

I sometimes tend to do this on the plane, in specific boring meetings, or even on the toilet.

## 3. Make it easy for yourself

Call me lazy, but I like making things easy for myself.

By that, I mean automating recurring tasks, creating templates, and using tools that help you.

Some examples:

- Notion to keep track of your articles and backlog
- Create a header template
- Make use of blogging platforms like [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips/joinme)
- Automate your social shares
- Convert old topics into new versions
- Use Grammarly to spellcheck

## 4. Promote your blog

Promoting your blog in the best way possible is super important. For me, it works best via my newsletter and Twitter.
But also think about Hashnode and Dev.to. You can promote your articles there super easily.

When sharing your articles, be aware of how people receive them. Does it look "spammy"? Does it help people?
There isn't a proper good or false, but be aware of how you position your blog.

## 5. Learn by doing

A super important tip, the first article will most likely suck, and even the second, third, etc.
You will only improve by actually doing something.
Gathering feedback, listening to your readers, and improving with that valuable information.

Start writing!
Don't wait till you have the perfect article or build your blog from scratch.

Just write your first article, do a spellcheck and publish it!
You can also go back and improve it.

That said, drop your blog in a tweet to me. I can't wait to read it!

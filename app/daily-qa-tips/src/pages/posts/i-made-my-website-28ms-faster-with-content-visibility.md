You might think, what is 28ms? If you are a big advocate of speeding up the web and getting perfect scores on [Eleventy's speedlify dashboard](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/), it's a lot!

Not that I was doing bad, as you can see in the screenshot below. I just wanted to get full 100's and get the full potential out of my website.

## Making use of content-visibility

I read about this CSS property a while ago. But never got round to implementing and testing it.
That is until today, so let's see what it actually does.

The content-visibility has three values we can use:

- `visible` (no effect, basically how it was before)
- `hidden` (a mix between display: none and visibility: hidden, it starts on display hidden, afterwords becomes visibility hidden)
- `auto` (This is the one we are looking at. It will only render this element once the browser needs it!)

So how can we add it to elements?

```css
.element {
  content-visibility: auto;
}
```

I've added this on my homepage to the article-list and footer elements.

## Before content-visibility

To give you a better understanding, I did a lighthouse test before these changes.

But more important is the actual trace where we can check the total time.

## After adding content-visibility

And then, after adding the content-visibility to those two elements, I've rerun the test.

And the trace:

That means it was 443ms and is now 415ms, which means + 28ms win!

Conclusion: There is no downside to not adding the `auto` one. It can only benefit your website, even the small numbers matter.

## Making sub-pages faster

I even added my `content-visibility` on the post pages, where the main content is set to `auto`.

The following screenshot is a before rendering:

And this is the after rendering:

As you can see, it improved my score overall.
And adding `content-visibility` made the Time to Interactive 1.1s faster.

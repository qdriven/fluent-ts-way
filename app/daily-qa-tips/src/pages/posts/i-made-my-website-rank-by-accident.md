You must be thinking, clickbait ü™ù, right?
Well, it kind of is, but also isn't.

I make my website rank on purpose but had an accidental big win on a specific topic.
Let me explain what happened.

## Looking through Google search console

Now and then, I like to take a Sunday to go through my search console, Ahrefs, and analytics.
This process includes checking broken links, seeing where I might have missed a broken image, and most importantly, where I can optimize!

On 27 June 2021, I wrote this article about [moving from GIF to video format](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/moving-from-gif-to-video-format/). And this article was purely written to make my website faster.

Which it did! These pages I changed became so much faster, so I was happy.

Back to now, I was checking my Google Search Console and noticed the following:

The screenshot above shows I got clicks and impressions on video content?
And although I did do some twitch before, this never really picked up. So I was surprised where these impressions and clicks came from.

Diving a bit deeper into the reports, I found the keywords used and decided to go through them in the video tab on google.

And on the "Chrome screenshot" query, I managed to find the following video snippet.

![Video snippet ranking in Google](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636522287001/VTarLr0j_.png)

Pretty impressive, as this is only an 8-second self-hosted video snippet. (Which used to be a GIF)

Here, you can see it in action: [Detecting faces from the webcam in JavaScript](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/detecting-faces-from-the-webcam-in-javascript/).

## Conclusion

Moving from GIF to video does not only make your website faster. It even helps get you ranked on video content!

I, for one, was super surprised as I haven't even optimized any on this content for that purpose.

Did you ever have random SEO wins?

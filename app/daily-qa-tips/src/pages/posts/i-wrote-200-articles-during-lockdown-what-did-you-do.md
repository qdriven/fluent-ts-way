Nice, my clickbait title got your attention!

I've been in South Africa for those who know me, and we have been in lockdown since March! (Still ongoing).

Today was the day I was supposed to fly back, but a lockdown in The Netherlands happened... So still in South Africa! 

As a celebration, I wanted to share my wins during this lockdown and inspire you. 
No matter what the situation is, you can make the best of it!

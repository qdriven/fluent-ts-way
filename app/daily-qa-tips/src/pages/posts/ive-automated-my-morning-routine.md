Call me lazy, but I love automating things.
Today we are automating my morning routine.

You may be wondering what that routine is.

- Make coffee (Shit, we won't automate this, Yet!)
- Open ten tabs

Yes, that last part we are automating using the magic and mighty `bash`!

See here how cool this project is:

## Bash opening browser tabs

> Note: This script is written/tested on Mac and can differ for you on different machines.

First, we will be making a plain old `.txt` file that will hold all the pages we want to open:

```
https://hashnode.com/
https://daily-dev-tips.com/
https://twitter.com/
```

Now we will be making a bash script to open all browser tabs:

```bash
alias google-chrome='/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome'
while reading line; do
    google-chrome --new-tab "$line"
done < ~/www/browser-hack/list.txt
```

I have defined the alias for google-chrome; I think you can leave the alias out (untested) on windows.

Then we will loop through each line defined in list.txt and call google chrome to open a new tab for that website.

Next, we can add an alias to make it even cooler:

```bash
alias morning=~/path/to/script/bash.sh
```

Now in your terminal, type: `morning` and see the magic happen.

Voila, we just hacked our morning routine to be that much quicker!

In this tutorial, we will learn **how to build a scrollable vertical slider using Tailwind CSS** and Eleventy. It will also come with a nice CSS _scroll-snap_ effect.

This example will become the homepage for my lifestyle blog. The result of today's article will look like this:

## Build a vertical slider in Tailwind CSS

We will start by coding our main container and the entire screen sections inside.

We have a total of five slider sections for the homepage:

```html
<main>
  <section class="w-full h-screen bg-red-200">Section 1</section>
  <section class="w-full h-screen bg-blue-200">Section 2</section>
  <section class="w-full h-screen bg-green-200">Section 3</section>
  <section class="w-full h-screen bg-indigo-200">Section 4</section>
  <section class="w-full h-screen bg-yellow-200">Section 5</section>
</main>
```

This code gives us the following result:

![Tailwind full-screen slider](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611641079716/6ObvYevmM.gif)

As you can see, each vertical slider section is our viewport's exact width/height.
Even if we resize it, the slider will stay fullscreen.

But we can only scroll to each section. How can we make the branches _snap_ during scrolling?

## Tailwind Slider with Scroll-snap

There is a very cool CSS property called **scroll-snap**. It can help us create this "scroll-snapping" behavior on the slider without custom JavaScript.

However, Tailwind CSS is missing the scroll-snap feature. So let's start by extending the tailwind utilities.

Open up the `global.css` file and add the following code:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .snap {
    scroll-snap-type: var(--scroll-snap-direction) var(--scroll-snap-constraint);
  }
  .snap-y {
    --scroll-snap-direction: y;
  }
  .snap-mandatory {
    --scroll-snap-constraint: mandatory;
  }
  .snap-start {
    scroll-snap-align: start;
  }
}
```

This will extend Tailwind and add the missing CSS classes we need for scroll-snap.

> Note: I only added the actual classes we need, not all the scroll-snap types.

Now let's add these classes to our HTML elements, starting with the `<main>` element.

```html
<main class="max-h-screen overflow-y-scroll snap snap-y snap-mandatory"></main>
```

First, we'll ensure the element has a max height on the screen and the overflow vertical is set to scroll.
Then we add our recently created snap classes which will render to the following:

```css
scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
```

Now we just need to tell our slider sections where they have to snap.

```html
<section class="w-full h-screen bg-red-200 snap-start"></section>
```

We added the `snap-start` class to each section, which will now render to behave as you can see in the GIF below.

![Tailwind slider with scroll snapping](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611642046686/VhpdCo0Ez.gif)

Pretty cool, right?

## Vertical slider final styling

Each of our slides will have its unique styling. The first section is a full-screen background image with the logo in the middle.

I've placed the images directly in the `src/images` folder.

First, we need to add a custom **background image** in our `tailwind.config.js` file. It will allow us to use the background image as a class easily.

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Other extends
      backgroundImage: {
        'home-1': "url('images/home-intro.jpg')",
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

Now we can use this background using the following class.

```html
class="bg-home-1"
```

The HTML for this section will look like this:

```html
<section
  class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-screen bg-center bg-cover snap-start bg-home-1"
>
  <img alt="The todoist logo" title="The Todoist Logo" src="images/logo.png" />
</section>
```

This will give us the following result:

![Homepage section one](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611642940879/fem_DYqqT.png)

Section two is the about page section which showcases an image with some offset text on top of it.

We will use [Tailwind CSS Grid](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/creating-a-newsletter-layout-with-tailwind/) as we did in the Newsletter layout.

```html
<section class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-screen snap-start">
  <div class="grid grid-flow-row grid-cols-12 grid-rows-1 gap-8">
    <div
      class="z-10 flex flex-col justify-center col-span-3 col-start-2 row-start-1"
    >
      <h1 class="font-black text-purple">About The Todoist</h1>
      <h3 class="text-pink">Coffee, Adrenaline, and a bunch off craziness</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col items-end col-span-6 col-start-3 row-start-1">
      <img src="https://thetodoist.com/static/media/home_about.104e3ad7.jpg" />
      <a href="/about" class="mt-2 text-xs underline">Find out more &rarr;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

I use the same start-row and start-col hack in this section to overlap the elements.

I then use [CSS Flex](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-flexbox-most-easy-center-vertical-and-horizontal/) to align the elements in the correct position.

The result for this section:

![Section two styling](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611643996904/efw-MmxxG.png)

> As you can see, it's an offset element. This is how it was designed. You could center it by adjusting the col-start position.

The third section it's an extensive section that showcases the featured post.

For this example, we will hardcode the article, and in a later stage, we will connect it to our data store.

```html
<section
  class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-screen text-white bg-purple snap-start"
>
  <div class="grid grid-flow-row grid-cols-12 grid-rows-1 gap-8">
    <div class="col-span-5 col-start-2">
      <img
        src="https://thetodoist.com/img/blog/forgotten-punctuation/overview.jpg"
      />
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col justify-center col-span-3 col-start-8">
      <h2 class="font-black">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</h2>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing, sed diam, sed diam.
      </p>
      <a href="#" class="mt-2 text-xs underline">Read more &rarr;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

This is again a section where I used mainly CSS Grid to create the elements next to each other and flex to align them.

The result for this section:

![Tailwind CSS Section styling](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611644836640/hsl2UtoVM.png)

The fourth section is very similar to the previous one. It showcases a blog item, however, focussing on the background image, like in section one.

Since this data will be populated from the actual blog item, we need to use an inlined background-image.

We can then use a div with a narrow text area width.

The full HTML for this section will look like this:

```html
<section
  class="flex items-center w-full h-screen bg-indigo-200 bg-center bg-cover text-purple snap-start"
  style="background-image: url(https://thetodoist.com/img/blog/beach-workouts/running.jpg)"
>
  <div class="w-1/12">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="w-3/12">
    <div class="relative">
      <span
        class="absolute flex w-full h-0.5 -ml-4 bg-purple -left-full top-1/2"
      ></span
      >Health
    </div>
    <a href="#">
      <h2>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</h2>
      <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing, sed diam, sed diam.
      </p>
    </a>
    <a href="#" class="mt-2 text-xs underline">Read more &rarr;</a>
  </div>
</section>
```

And this will give us the following result:

![Full-screen slider section in Tailwind CSS](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611645479919/Menj524h3.png)

The last slide is the contact section.
I will change the design a little bit, so we don't have the form anymore.

The tricky part here is enabling the background pattern for this section.

Let's first add this pattern to our tailwind.config file.

```js
backgroundImage: {
  "home-1": "url('images/home-intro.jpg')",
  "pattern-striped": "url('images/pattern-striped.png')",
},
```

Now we can use this on our slide:

```html
<section class="w-full h-screen bg-pattern-striped snap-start"></section>
```

The rest of the block uses a grid and flex to align the items.

```html
<section class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-screen bg-pattern-striped snap-start">
  <div class="grid grid-flow-row grid-cols-12 grid-rows-1 gap-8">
    <div class="col-span-10 col-start-2">
    <h2 class="font-black">Coffee? Sure let's do it.</h2>
    <strong class="flex w-1/2">Always up for meeting new people, learning stuff, and trying new things, so please give me a shout-out if you want to be in touch.</strong>

    <div class="flex mt-8">
      <div class="w-1/2">
        <h4>Contact me</h4>
        <p>Send me an email on <a class="underline" href="mailto:info@thetodoist.com">info@thetodoist.com</a></p>
      </div>
      <div class="w-1/2">
        <h4>Currently in</h4>
        <p>Cape Town, South Africa</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

This will render in the following result.

![slide with contact section](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611646060342/8hQgMx-d2.png)

There we go. We now have our full vertical scrollable homepage slider in Tailwind and Eleventy.

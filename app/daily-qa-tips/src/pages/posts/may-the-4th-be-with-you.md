Whether you remember the death (for the Dutch readers), or celebrating Star Wars day.

The 4th of May is a day packed with memories.
Being a Dutch guy who also loves Star Wars, what started as both for me turned into something even bigger last year.

## Why this is a non-technical article

You might be wondering why I'm skipping a technical article just as we are diving into Remix.

Well, this day has another special meaning to me.

If you are an avid reader, you might already know.
For those who don't.

It's my wedding day!

So I decided to take the day to write a technical article.
And wishing all of you a wonderful 4th of May.

Let us remember that there are bigger things in life than working 24/7, and we should also take some time off to spend quality time with our loved ones.

## We don't believe you

I get it. Maybe I'm not even married. You haven't seen any proof, right?

Since the photos took a while to come in, here are some of my top pics from our wedding day.

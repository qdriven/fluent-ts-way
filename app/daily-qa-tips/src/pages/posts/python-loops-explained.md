Besides the [Python data types](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/data-types-in-python/) I've walked through just the other day, loops are an essential part of programming.

Today we'll be looking at loops in Python, and there are two types I'll explain in this article.

- For loop
- While loop

## Python for loop

Let me first show you how a basic for loop in Python looks:

```python
for x in y:
    # Do something
```

Based on this example, you can already see it translates to:
For each element X inside of statement Y, Evaluate a code block.

Let's say we have a list of animals and would like to print each animal.

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "penguin", "tiger"]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)
```

This will result in the following:

```
cat
dog
penguin
tiger
```

We can also use the range to loop x amount of times. Let's say we want to make a loop go four times.

```python
for item in range(4):
    print("Happy Birthday")
```

Wil print out:

```
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
```

## Python while loop

Besides the for loop, there is also the option to loop while a specific condition is met.

The basics for a while loop are like this:

```python
while x == True:
    # Do something
```

With that, we say while X is true, you must keep executing this code block.
If we used the code above, we would build an infinite loop.

So let's make a basic while loop and break it after the first run so it only executes once

```python
foo = True
while foo == True:
    print("Foo is true")
    foo = False

print("Foo is false now!")
```

And this code block will return the following:

```
Foo is true
Foo is false now!
```

You've seen the range option, but we could also use a while loop.

```python
number = 2

while number < 5:
    print("Still smaller")
    number = number + 1
```

This gives us:

```
Still smaller
Still smaller
Still smaller
```

And there, you have the basics of two versions to loop code blocks in Python.

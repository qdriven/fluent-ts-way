Following my article about the [top 10 visual studio code plugins](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/top-10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-need-to-install/) and [5 full-stack projects](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/5-full-stack-projects-to-add-to-your-portfolio-before-2020-ends/) we are now looking at Chrome extensions.

## 1. Daily.dev

![Daily.dev Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737063827/9XR9IO1Gt.png)

Daily.dev became my go-to extension! They provide a default opening tab that shows you the most awesome dev news.
And keep an eye out. You might find one of my articles there.

[Install daily.dev](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dailydev-news-for-busy-de/jlmpjdjjbgclbocgajdjefcidcncaied)

## 2. WhatRuns

![WhatRuns Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737141643/Cgmo4qvon.png)

I'm sure you ever wondered what stack a website was using.
This extension will tell you super quickly what's going on.
It even tells you specific versions.

[Install WhatRuns](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatruns/cmkdbmfndkfgebldhnkbfhlneefdaaip)

## 3. Coil

![Coil Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737297580/wEZlKMgqf.png)

Coil is a fantastic extension for getting paid for viewing content. If you read excellent content, think about getting a Coil subscription.

[Install Coil](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coil/locbifcbeldmnphbgkdigjmkbfkhbnca)

## 4. Grammarly for Chrome

![Grammarly Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737377541/IRWjNG3OC.jpeg)

Although this is more of a "writers" extension, I think everyone can benefit from using Grammarly. The extension works great on all kinds of websites.

[Install Grammarly for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen)

## 5. Web Developer

![Web Developer Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737107878/LHo8Z_Ays.png)

I think this is my number one used plugin. It has so many great tools built in, including form fill, cookie clearing, image disabling, and many more!

[Install Web Developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm)

## 6. Tag Assistant (by Google)

![Tag Assistant Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737579624/G-olEuZ7T.png)

Tag Assistant is fantastic, and if you are using it, you can't live without this extension. It will show you all tags and when they will be called.

[Install Tag Assistant](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk)

## 7. Lorem Ipsum Generator

![Lorem Ipsum Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737670127/qWoHlDuc9.png)

We all love Lorem Ipsum. This extension will quickly provide you with a bunch of copy that you can use as placeholder text.

[Install Lorem Ipsum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lorem-ipsum-generator-def/mcdcbjjoakogbcopinefncmkcamnfkdb)

## 8. ColorZilla

![ColorZilla Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737718243/4UUvDSYut.png)

Ever needed an exact color from a website? This extension will give you a nice hex color and has an excellent picker.
It even copies directly to your clipboard.

[Install ColorZilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp)

## 9. Window Resizer

![Window Resizer Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737768852/v8sr0rT5z.png)

Nowadays, we are working on many media queries, and it's impossible to "guess" and resize them. This tool will give you the exact size of several devices.

[Install Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh)

## 10. Lighthouse

![Lighthouse Chrome extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599737810982/VwvF3D-PB.png)

Another great thing that comes with Chrome is Lighthouse. We can use it from the console, but this extension makes it quicker and easier to open a report.

[Install Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk)

Yesterday we had a brief introduction to the History API by using the [`pushState`](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/vanilla-javascript-update-url-without-refresh/) method.

Today we'll dive more into the History API and see what other elements we can use.

## JavaScript Browser API Back and Forward

So, we want to navigate through the history programmatically instead of refreshing the current URL. The History API has three methods of doing so:

- `back()` is the Same as clicking the back button in the browser
- `forward()` is the Same as clicking the forward button
- `go()` We can go to a specific index forward (`1`) or backward (`-1`)

In action, the `back()` method looks like this:

```js
window.history.back();
```

The `forward()` in turn, looks like this:

```js
window.history.forward();
```

And the `go()` we can use like this:

```js
window.history.go(-1); // back
window.history.go(1); // forward
window.history.go(0); // refresh
window.history.go(); // refresh
```

You can determine how many pages are in the history by using the following command:

```js
const numberInHistory = window.history.length;
```

## JavaScript History API replaceState

As we saw, we can use [`pushState`](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/vanilla-javascript-update-url-without-refresh/) to change the current state, we can also use `replaceState` for this:

```js
history.replaceState({ page: 'unicorn' }, 'Unicorn', '/Unicorn');
```

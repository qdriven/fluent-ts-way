After we build a [JavaScript text-to-speech application](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/vanilla-javascript-text-to-speech/), now let's turn the tables and make the computer listen to what we say!

We will create a piece of code that will start listening to us and compile to text.

For this example, we will use the `SpeechRecognition` interface.

This interface comes with quite a few properties, which we won't all be using for this demo.

- `grammars`: Returns a set of `SpeechGrammar` objects
- `lang`: Defaults to the HTML lang attribute, but can be manually set
- `continuous`: Can be set to true, default is false and means it will stop after it thinks you're done
- `interimResults`: Boolean that tells us if the interim results should be returned as well.
- `maxAlternatives`: The recognition will guess what you say and by default return only 1 result. We can however, tell it to return more.
- `serviceURI`: By default we use the user agent speech service, but we can define a specific one!

The end result of what we are building will look like this:

## Detecting browser support

Since not all browsers fully support this method, we will need to detect if our browser has this option.

```js
const SpeechRecognition =
  window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
```

Here we define a const to check if the support is defined.

We can then easily check this const.

```js
if (SpeechRecognition !== undefined) {
  // Do the speech stuff
} else {
  console.warn('sorry not supported ðŸ˜­');
}
```

## JavaScript speech to text

Now that we defined our browser supports this feature, we can go ahead a start working on recording our voice.

Let's first make a very simple `HTML` setup.

We are going to need a status text to tell the user what's going on, we also need a button to start listening.
And an output div to place our results in.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to our speech to text tool</h1>
  <h4 id="status">Press the button below, and start speaking</h4>
  <button onclick="startRecognition()">Speech to text</button>
  <div id="result" class="hide"></div>
</div>
```

Let's start by defining these as variables so we can use them.

```js
const status = document.getElementById('status'),
  result = document.getElementById('result');
```

The next step is to create our `startRecognition` function.

```js
startRecognition = () => {
  if (SpeechRecognition !== undefined) {
    let recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
  } else {
    console.warn('sorry not supported ðŸ˜­');
  }
};
```

If the recognition is supported, we create a new `SpeechRecognition` interface.

This doesn't do anything yet because it isn't started.

But before we start it, let's define some events that it comes with to capture states.

First, we'll define the start.

```js
recognition.onstart = () => {
  status.innerHTML = `Starting listening, speak in the microphone please ðŸ¦»`;
  output.classList.add('hide');
};
```

This function will be called once the `onstart` event is triggered. We will use it to give the user a status update that we are listening.

The next job is to see when the user is done speaking.

```js
recognition.onspeechend = () => {
  status.innerHTML = `I stopped listening `;
  recognition.stop();
};
```

Here we tell the user in our status element that we stopped listening to them.
We also manually stop the recognition.

Now we need to receive the actual results.

```js
recognition.onresult = (result) => {
  console.log(result);
};
```

This function is called when the results are in, and they come as a `SpeechRecognitionEvent`.

Which looks like this:

![JavaScript Speech recognition event](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607581513006/RG56gxSgt.png)

We are interested in the results however.

These are parsed as `SpeechRecognitionResults` and as mentioned, can be multiple if you use the `maxAlternatives`.

In our example, we will stick to one, and such a result will look like this:

![SpeechRecognitionResult](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607581665979/asPQRWTOo.png)

You can see where this is going right. We can use the transcript to get the text it guessed we spoke.
And there is a confidence which is how certain it is you said something.

Let's add this to our output element.

```js
recognition.onresult = (result) => {
  output.classList.remove('hide');
  output.innerHTML = `I'm ${Math.floor(
    result.results[0][0].confidence * 100
  )}% certain you just said: <b>${result.results[0][0].transcript}</b>`;
};
```

Now, all we have to do is add the start!

```js
recognition.start();
```

The first time we run this and click the button, it will prompt our microphone access.

![Microphone access](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607582332064/VEQGIzy-S.png)

Once we have done that, we can start speaking and see the transcript coming in our output.

Wow, we just made the computer listen to us, how awesome right.

## Browser Support

Sad enough, this isn't a fully supported feature yet! I think it will be bigger and bigger since speech, in general, is getting more needed for the web.

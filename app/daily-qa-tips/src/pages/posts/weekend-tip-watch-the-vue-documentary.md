Start the weekend with this developer tip!
I enjoyed watching the `vue.js` documentary, which I was very inspired by.

The documentary shows how `vue.js` migrated from a fun project to a prominent framework in the JavaScript community.

I really like that something you build for yourself turns into something that millions of people use every day. All this is due to being a leader, pushing through, and keeping true to what you want it to do.

## Why side projects are important

Side projects are an essential part of a developer's lifecycle, not just because they can become the next `vue.js`.
But because they allow you to experiment, try new languages, and perhaps help you with personal issues.

## How to find your own side project

1. **Refactor an old application.** It's fantastic to rewrite something you did before. You know the ins and outs, but refactor them in a new language.

2. **Fix a problem** you or your friends have... My wife, for example, did not have a good bookkeeping tool that was free to use, so we are building her own one from scratch.

3. **Start a blog** like this or a personal blog to keep busy by writing new content and improving the website.

4. **Work on your portfolio.** Even as developers, these are important and define who we are, you can view mine here [chrisbongers.com](https://chrisbongers.com)

5. **Try and replicate a [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) shot** in `HTML/css/js`. I will do some of these later, but it's a perfect exercise.

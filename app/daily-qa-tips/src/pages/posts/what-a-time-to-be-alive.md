I mean, isn't it great?
We have all this technology making our lives so easy, we're able to travel easier than ever, and we keep getting challenged on a personal level.

I truly enjoy living in the now. It's a time that fits my personality.

But times are different. Do you ever note this when speaking to your parents or grandparents?

They might not even understand what your job is, let alone why in the world you would marry someone from the opposite side of the world and travel so much.

But I love it! I'm happy to be alive in the now.

It's easy to forget that we should be very grateful for where we are now.
Imagine being born when we had to run for dinosaurs or when world wars were happening.

(And don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of bad stuff going on in the world, but more about that in another article)

## Why does this excite me?

Let me sketch the scenario. I'm sitting at a table at Schiphol Airport (Amsterdam) while writing this article.

And it will even be scheduled and deployed, all by pressing some keys on my computer.

This just amazes me. When you told my 12-year-old self that such a thing was possible, I would have envisioned a Star Trek kind of movie.

And with that, my expectations keep increasing every time some new technology advances and makes our lives better.

That is the exact reason why I'm so happy to be alive in this era, where we can be part of this!

## But what about the future?

Yeah, the future, something no one can predict, yet many dream of it. And it could be an even better place.

I'm sure some of you reading this will experience, and maybe this will inspire you to write about that future?

Wow, that would be something, right?

So without making this a winding story, I just wanted to write down how happy I am to live in the present before boarding my flight ✈️.

I'm writing this article, especially for you.

The loyal reader, the person who is planning to grow by learning.
The person who is a close replica of how I learn and grow.

What kind of articles are you missing?
I'd love to get some insights into what could help you become even better?

## Ideas and suggestions

So far, I have a couple of topics with various audiences.

- CSS fun things (Much like the [CSS logos series](https://daily-dev-tips.com/tags/css-logos/))
- JavaScript functions explaining one specific function
- Projects that we build from start to finish
- Offtopic chats
- Deeper specific topics

You might favor one of these approaches, or something completely different, like "react" articles.

I hope to receive your opinion on which articles and what kind of article type works best for you.

## How to provide this feedback

You can either send me a message on Twitter (public or DM) or respond to my email (info@daily-dev-tips.com).

Let me know what has been the best help/topic/article so far for you in a couple of words.

And let's work together on making you become 10x better than that.

By the time you are reading this, I've said "Yes, I do" to my wife.
And we are already on our honeymoon!

Therefore I'm not going to make this long, I've thought about this hard and it's time to put in a break.

It's been 413 consecutive days of writing, and I think I deserve a small break.

Let's say we see each other again on the 15th, so you only have to miss my writing for 10 days.

From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank every single one of you for reading and sharing my articles.

See you soon,

Chris

Wow, 100 days fly by so quickly! Can you imagine I've written 100 articles in 100 days already?

I've started this challenge just before lockdown to keep me busy and sane, and so far, it's been working very well.

Also, it's hard some days to find a fresh topic to write about, but the bigger the audience, the more input I'm receiving, which makes it easier to write.

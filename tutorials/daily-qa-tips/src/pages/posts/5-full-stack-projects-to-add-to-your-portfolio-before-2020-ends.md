Let's dive right into it!

Who doesn't love movies? And React! This project is perfect for getting started with React and showing you how to work with API's and Styled components.

What you will learn

- React + Hooks
- Styled components
- API Usage
- States using hooks

All and all, a very great tutorial to get started with React!

Ionic, is a hybrid mobile platform, which I adore üíô. So let's make a graphical Instagram clone. It's always good to re-create something just to understand the work that goes in certain websites and applications.

What you will learn:

- Ionic structure and setup
- Creating new pages and routing
- Styling an ionic app
- Styling based on an example application

This tutorial can be found on pusher [Instagram Clone](https://pusher.com/tutorials/instagram-clone-ionic-part-1) and does not include the back-end side, BUT with some googling, you'll make that work (Firebase üî•).

## 3. Building a blog with Gatsby üé©

![Build your own blog with Gatsby](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598543705959/MHlvSgG1J.png)

Gatsby is a fantastic React-based framework, and a lot of people are building blogs based on it.

[Scott Spence](https://twitter.com/spences10) wrote a fantastic full-blown tutorial on how to get started building your own blog on Gatsby.

What you will learn:

- Custom layouts
- Styled components
- Syntax highlighting blocks
- SEO! Very important
- Deploying to Netlify üëÄ

So, no stopping you now, go ahead show us your blog!

You can find this tutorial on freecodecamp [Building a Gatsby blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/)

Confession: I ‚ù§Ô∏è food!

If you do too, this project is your thing to tackle. We are building a food ordering app using Next.js, a fantastic and powerful upcoming framework. And Strapi, which makes it easy to build API's without all the booh-hah.

What we will learn:

- React hooks
- GraphQL
- Stripe payments!
- Strapi
- Styling

This really is a full-on project, and you will learn so much from doing a project like this. You can find this on the Strapi blog and it's very extensive! [Next.js Strapi food app](https://strapi.io/blog/nextjs-react-hooks-strapi-food-app-1).

## 5. Build a JavaScript powered Candy Crush üíé

What you will learn

- JavaScript Listeners
- JavaScript Creating and removing elements
- Styling the game

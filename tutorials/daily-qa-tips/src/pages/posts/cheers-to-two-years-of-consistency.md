I think I can officially say I've been consistent. It was exactly two years ago I started the blog.

And wow, how have things changed since then? I think I'm most proud of having motivated people to start writing, improve every day, and never stop learning.

I just finished the [700 articles post](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/how-writing-700-articles-changed-my-life/), so I won't do another one of those now.

But let's take a minute to talk about consistency, what it entails, and how it can help you.

> Note: I'll be talking about personal experience here

## What consistency is to me

Consistency is doing something without hassle at a set time frame.

Let's take writing articles as my example, I do this every morning, and it never feels like a "must-do".

The goal with this is to turn consistency into a habit.
It's almost like eating breakfast, going to bed, or doing your job.

These are all things you do without even thinking about it, and they are just so implemented in your workflow that you'd have to make an effort not to do them one day.

And that's the point where I'm at with learning/writing this blog. I have to force myself not to do it, which rarely happens.

So with that being said, I think I succeeded in turning my consistency into a healthy habit.

## How small improvements work best

I've chosen this daily blog as my outlet to keep on learning as a developer.
And even though it's small improvements every day, it accumulates to a big growth over these past two years.

Even if I took two months off from work, I'm sure I wouldn't have learned as much as just spending this small amount every day.

Accumulated learning is the way to go for me.

Another benefit of this method is that you learn to break things up.
You can't simply build a Twitter clone in an hour. You have to break it up into small steps, which makes it a super maintainable project to tackle.

## How long will you take this on?

I said I'll do every day without missing any days in 2022, so I'm still working on that.

From there, it depends. If you ask me now, I'd say I'll keep going, but you know life might happen, and things might change my feelings about doing this blog.

In modern-day `CSS`, the styles are divided among many selectors. Even tools like Tailwind make this happen.

But what if we want to get all `CSS` styles for one element?

Chrome dev tools has this fantastic feature built in.

This is how it works:

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/daily-dev-tips/video/upload/q_auto/copy-styles_ctgu5l.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/daily-dev-tips/video/upload/q_auto/copy-styles_squuvy.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Chrome Dev tools Copy CSS Styles

To use it:

- Open dev tools
- Right-click an element in the `Elements` panel
- Copy > Copy styles
- Paste them where needed

Excellent and easy, right? You won't know the number of times this can be useful!

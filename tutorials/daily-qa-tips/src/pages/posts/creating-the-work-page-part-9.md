What would our portfolio be without a dedicated work page, right?

Let's get started on creating this. Hopefully, we can reuse some of the components we already created when [working on the homepage](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/styling-the-featured-work-section-part-7/), as we see for the [blog page](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/creating-the-blog-page-part-8/).

As a reminder, the work page looks like this in the design file.

## Creating the work page

Let's start by adding a new page to our pages directory. We'll call this file `work.js`.
The rough outline for it will look like this:

```js
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function WorkPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>NextJS Work</title>
        <meta name='description' content='Generated by create next app' />
        <link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />
      </Head>
      <section>
        <div>
          <h1>Work</h1>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We can reuse all the classes we used in yesterday's [blog page](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/creating-the-blog-page-part-8/).

```html
<section className="px-6">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 p-4">Work</h1>
  </div>
</section>
```

Now let's add some mockup work components we created before.

```js
import Head from 'next/head';
import Work from '../components/work';

export default function WorkPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>NextJS Work</title>
        <meta name='description' content='Generated by create next app' />
        <link rel='icon' href='/favicon.ico' />
      </Head>
      <section className='px-6'>
        <div className='max-w-4xl mx-auto'>
          <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-6 p-4'>Work</h1>
          <Work />
          <Work />
          <Work />
          <Work />
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Let's see how it looks when we run our app and visit the work page.

Wow, this one works out of the box. Thank you, reusable components.

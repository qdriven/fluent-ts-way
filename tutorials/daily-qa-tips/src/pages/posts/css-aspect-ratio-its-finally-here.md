If you're a front-end developer, you must have looked up "CSS Aspect Ratio" more than once.

One of these things one would expect to be existing in CSS for a long time, but it was not! (Well, not really)

There are [some hacks](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/) to achieve it.

But not a proper aspect-ratio solution, until now, that is!

Chrome just got support for the `aspect-ratio` property.

To give you an example of how it works:

![CSS aspect-ratio demo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611725841854/SD7zMTaj8.gif)

## Using the CSS aspect-ratio

The syntax for the `aspect-ratio` is pretty simple.

```css
aspect-ratio: width / height;
```

Alternatively, you have some CSS basics like:

```css
aspect-ratio: inherit;
aspect-ratio: initial;
aspect-ratio: unset;
```

To test it out, let's make a resizable box to test how it works.

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```

Inside the container, we will place two boxes that will have their own aspect ratios

Box 1 will have an aspect ratio of 1/1
And Box 2 will have a 16/9 aspect ratio.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box box1"></div>
  <div class="box box2"></div>
</div>
```

First, we'll start by styling the container. We want it to wrap the elements inside but add the [CSS Resize property](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/making-divs-user-resizable-with-css/).

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 16px;
  resize: horizontal;
  overflow: auto;
}
```

Then we can move to our generic box styling. This will be the styling that each box will get.

```css
.box {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: #fff;
}
```

As you can see, this is mainly used to center the content inside the boxes and give them a bigger font.

Now onto the magic part ðŸª„.

### CSS square aspect-ratio 1/1

For our first box, we will use a square aspect ratio. We can achieve this by using the following CSS.

```css
.box1 {
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  background: #06d6a0;
  flex: 1;
}
```

This will provide us with a square box that can grow in size.

### CSS rectangle aspect-ratio 16/9

The second box will have a 16/9 aspect ratio, which we can achieve by the following CSS.

```css
.box2 {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  background: #ef476f;
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}
```

Now we get the following result which you can test out in this Codepen.

> Note: Browser support is not big, so you might not see it behave as expected. In the beginning, I added the GIF to showcase how it works.

## Browser Support

It's still very early days for the `aspect-ratio` browser support. Chrome shipped it in production in version 88, and Firefox has it in beta so that you can enable it in Firefox.

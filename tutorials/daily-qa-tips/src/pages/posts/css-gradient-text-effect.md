Today we are creating a super cool and pretty quick `CSS` effect.
I love this effect. It's not super happy and can be made just by CSS.

Because it's `CSS` based, we can even animate it if we want to. (I'll leave that up to you)

The result of today's article:

I'll guide you through creating this excellent effect yourself in just a few lines of CSS!

## HTML Structure

As for the HTML, we only need the following:

```html
<h1>Super Cool<br />Gradient Effect</h1>
```

As you can see, I've added a break (`<br />`) just because I like to showcase it even works on two lines.

## CSS Gradient text effect

Now let's move to our `CSS` setup.

We'll start by styling our body to center our element inside the `<h1>`.

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background: #000;
}
```

I use [CSS Grid to center everything](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-grid-most-easy-center-vertical-and-horizontal/) ideally.

Then in my example, I'm using a black background to make it pop more.

Now we need to get cracking on our heading style.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 6vmax;
}
```

We start by defining a font we like and making it nice and big.
I'm using a `6vmax`, a [scalable viewport unit](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/how-to-work-with-css-viewport-units/).

This results in the following:

![CSS gradient text step 1](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607763698175/ePoc38t7j.png)

The next step is to add our gradient. We are using the background-image to set our gradient.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 6vmax;
  background-color: #5390d9;
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, #6930c3, #5390d9);
}
```

As you can see, I also set a fallback color in case the gradient isn't supported.

I'm using a primary [`CSS` linear gradient](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-linear-gradients/) with only two colors.
You can extend these to support even more colors or fancy gradients.

> You can use this excellent generator for [CSS gradients](https://cssgradient.io/)

Our result so far is pretty weird:

![CSS Linear gradient text](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607763874175/079T7ZPfs.png)

As you can see above, the text is now black and has a gradient surrounding it. It's close, but we're not there yet.

Let's add the text gradient effect.

We use the `background-clip` property and set the `text-fill-color` to transparent.

The background-clip ensures the gradient goes on top of the text, and the text-fill will make it pop through.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 6vmax;
  background-color: #5390d9;
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, #6930c3, #5390d9);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  -moz-background-clip: text;
  -moz-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
```

Now that we get this fantastic result look around on this Codepen.

## Browser Support

This whole setup doesn't have full support, but the elements these days are widely supported.

I've shown the background-clip since it's an important part.

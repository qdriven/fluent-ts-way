For today's article, we'll recreate the iconic Netflix logo. While working on this logo, I found it was quite an easy one.

Super fun to try yourself ðŸ’–

Let's take a look at the logo.

## Analysing the logo

The logo is built up by three sticks of the same size; however, the middle one casts a shadow and is skewed.

Then at the bottom, it's good to note the logo is a bit rounded off.

My idea is to leverage borders for the two side pillars and pseudo-elements to make the skew stick + the rounded bottom section.

## Recreating the Netflix logo in CSS

Let's create a simple box and set the borders left and right to get started.

```css
.netflix {
  height: 15rem;
  width: 3rem;
  border-left: 3rem solid #e50914;
  border-right: 3rem solid #e50914;
  position: relative;
}
```

It's important to note the `3rem` will be the size for each stick.

So far, we get the following styled element.

Let's add a before element to add the third skew line.
The main idea is that this can be simply the width and height of the box.

```css
&:before {
  display: block;
  content: '';
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #e50914;
  transform: skewX(21.5deg);
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px black;
}
```

We can see we skew the element to fit the edges and add a bit of box-shadow to cast the shadow on the sticks below.

The last thing we need is the bottom rounded effect.
We'll leverage a round box that we offset from the bottom.

```css
&:after {
  content: '';
  width: 15rem;
  height: 2rem;
  background: black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  left: -200%;
  top: 98%;
}
```

Which result in the following CodePen.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="NWXGWvd" data-user="rebelchris" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

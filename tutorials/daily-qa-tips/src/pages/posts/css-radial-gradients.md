Yesterday we looked at [CSS Linear Gradiants](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/css-linear-gradients/).
And as promised, today we'll look into **radial gradients**. These gradients show from a round perspective.

## Types of CSS Gradients

As a reminder, there are two types of gradients we can leverage in `CSS`. These types are:

- `Linear Gradient`: From one side to the other side
- `Radial Gradient`: Round gradient

It's best to view them in action and see what they can do.

## CSS Radial Gradient

The radial gradient is defined by its center and moves from there.

In the most basic example, we can use it like this:

```css
.basic-radial {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow);
}
```

This will shift from red (inside) colors to the yellow (outside) color spectrum.

### Radial Gradient with Multiple Colors

We can also define multiple colors for the radial gradient, much like the linear gradient. Let's look at an example with four colors:

```css
.multi-radial {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue);
}
```

We can also define the gradient **position** for the colors:

```css
.position-radial {
  background-image: radial-gradient(red 10%, yellow 50%, green 90%);
}
```

### Transparent Radial Gradients

We can even make the gradient **transparent**, which can be used for some cool overlay effects. To create a transparent gradient, we have to use the RGBA color spectrum:

```css
.transparent-radial {
  background-image: radial-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 1));
}
```

### Radial Gradient Shape

By default, the radial gradient will use an ellipse shape. We can change it to a circle too. But there are only these two options.

#### Shapes of radial gradients

- circle
- ellipse

Example:

```css
.shape-gradient {
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red 10%, yellow 20%);
}
```

### Repeat Radial Gradient

And for who knows what reason, we can **repeat** the gradient as well with this code:

```css
.repeat-radial {
  background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
}
```

## Browser Support

CSS Gradients are very well supported. Just Opera Mini is not working, and not all browsers support the complete set of options.

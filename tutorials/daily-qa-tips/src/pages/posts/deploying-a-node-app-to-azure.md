This article is not about building a `Node.js` app but about deploying your first app on Azure.

Azure is mighty, fast, and easier to start with than you think.

I recently made a sort-like application for a company and thought it would be good to show everyone how to go about hosting your first Node app on Azure.

Check my article on [starting your first Node.js app](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/basic-nodejs-express-application/).
Or download this starter package on [GitHub](https://github.com/rebelchris/Node-url-shortener).

## Registering on Azure

First, we need to get an Azure account, head to their [register page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), and follow instructions.

Once logged in, we see this.

Now click on the `App Services` since we will use it.

We then get a prompt to start our free Trial. If we have not already done this, please follow these steps.

## Creating our App Service in Azure

Our Node app will be running on an App Service on Azure. So from the App Services screen, click on create new.

![Create new App Service](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600705461881/eE-akzlIY.png)

An App Service is a container that will run our application, and it can run several runtimes options.

For our instance, we are using the following settings.

![App Service settings](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600705522748/NREOGDdh8.png)

> If you don't have a resource group yet, you can click the new button on Resource Group.

We won't be using any monitoring, so leave that to no.

We also won't use Tags, so click to the end and push `Create`!

![App Service Create](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600705644345/XshQ4UFmZ.png)

There we go. We created an empty Azure App Service, which looks like this if we follow the URL.

## Uploading our Node app to Azure App Service

> You can use my Starter project from [GitHub](https://github.com/rebelchris/Node-url-shortener).

So there are multiple ways of pushing our code to our new App Service.

Let's start by exploring their Visual Studio code extension first!

You can [download the Azure Visual Studio code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) here.

Once installed, open your project in Visual Studio Code.

You will now see this side icon. Click it and authenticate with your Azure account.

![Visual Studio Code, Azure extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600705808624/40Vhzi0kJ.png)

We can right-click our newly created App Service and click `Deploy to Web App`.

![Deploy web app](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600705856714/nTixdG0S9.png)

Now visit your Azure-created URL.

And we can even visit another route.

## Azure Web App deployments

We can find our recent push deployment in the following section in Azure.

![Azure Deployment Center](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600706012450/OMK-7aBvo.png)

There we go. We created a Node app hosted on Azure Web Services.

You can find the entire project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rebelchris/Node-url-shortener)

Next time we will explore GitHub Deployments, Custom domains, and Storage options!

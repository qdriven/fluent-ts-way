It's only natural for us humans, to get distracted by literally anything other than what we should focus on.

The same can be said for reading articles.
Luckily for us, more and more product are trying to help us by creating focus modes, and like minded features.

For browsers there is a feature called reader mode, it removes all the distractions from the webpage so you can focus on the content itself.

## Enabling reader mode in Chrome

For Chrome however, this is not yet a public feature, but you can enable it today!

And i'll show you how you can do just that.

Open up your Google Chrome browser and in the address bar type the following link: `chrome://flags`.

This will open a page where you can control certain flags for your browser.

In the top search field search for: **"Enable Reader Mode"**.

You'll notice a dropdown on the side of it, it should be set to `default`. Change this value to be `enabled`.

Today, we'll be covering getting started with Deno! Deno is a `JavaScript` server language like `node.js` but built-in `Typescript`.
It's designed to improve the shortcomings of `node.js`.

It's been quite hyped over the last couple of months, and even when writing this article, I have zero experience with it, so this guide is also my guide.

## What is TypeScript?

As mentioned, `TypeScript` is a superset of `JavaScript`. TypeScript is a strongly typed language, meaning types must be defined when declaring variables. This makes it more strict and easier to spot errors and faults.

## Setting up Deno

To get started, we need to install Deno locally first.

If you are on Linux/Mac, run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

If you're on Windows:

```bash
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

> Note: You can find your install package on the [Deno website](https://deno.land/)

You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
deno --help
```

## Our First Deno Application

So let's start by creating our first Deno application.

Create a new folder, and our starting file `server.ts`

```bash
mkdir deno && cd deno
```

Let's start adding lines to our `server.ts` file.

```js
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.63.0/http/server.ts';
```

This tells our server to import the `serve` module from a URL; in `node.js` we would have to use `npm install` first!

Now we are going to create a new Deno server:

```js
const server = serve({ port: 1337 });
```

We are starting our server on port 1337.

Sending a response to the browser

```js
for await (const req of server) {
  req.respond({ body: 'Hello Deno!!' });
}
```

So this is a bit different than what we see in `node.js`.
We loop through each incoming request, returning a body for each request!

## Running Our Deno Server

To run our deno server, we can run the following command in our terminal.

```bash
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

Now we can open our browser and go to `localhost:1337`. We should now see our body!

Excellent, getting started was quick and easy!

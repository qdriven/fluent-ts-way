People keep asking me the same question, how do you manage to write every single day?

But I see these kinds of questions pop everywhere, whether it is a YouTuber doing videos quite often or people pushing out e-books at an enormous pace.

I can't speak for these people, but I can tell you how to approach this time hack.

## Why do you want to hack time?

Hacking time is an excellent way to get more or different things done.
You as a person can't change the fact that there are 24 hours in a day.

You want to be able to do as much as possible in the little time you got.

And yes, this can be a variety of things:

- I want to play more games
- I want to exercise more
- I want to help a Noble cause
- I want to publish more articles
- I want to learn more about this or that topic

As you can see, there are many things we as humans want to achieve, and there is a way to get more done than you are doing now!

## Hack your time wisely

When it comes to hacking time, you might think of the obvious one.
Cut down on your sleep, and you will have more time for other stuff.
But this is far from true, at least for me.

I used to be a person that only had about 5 hours of sleep each night, and the moment I changed this to be 8+ hours, I actually became more productive.

But that is not nescesarry the hack I'm talking about today.

This hack involves assessing your time at the moment.
And you can do this very low-leveled.

After every activity, you do ask yourself did it contribute to your happiness, did it enrich you?

Some examples:

- You spend 6 hours watching a show you didn't even enjoy
- You had to visit that aunt you don't even like
- You traveled 2 hours to a job you don't enjoy
- You went shopping for 4 hours and hated it

Simple things like that, can you cut the down?

For me, the main dominator was travel time and watching shows.
Of course, you still want and need to relax, so please don't fully give up on fun things. But cut them out to do something you want to.

## I don't have time that I want to give up?

Well that is unfortunate, are you sure you can't make your time more efficient?

Can you combine specific tasks?
Watching a show while doing your laundry, or watching it while being on a home trainer, for instance.

Can you do some meetings while driving to work?

But all and all, it's about being happy with your day.
Meaning if you find your day fulfilling and you did enough, it's a good day!

I hope you can cut down on some time and make your life even better!

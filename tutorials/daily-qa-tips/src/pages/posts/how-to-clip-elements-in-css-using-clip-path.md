I've never really learned the clip-path concept, and this article is a change in that habit.
I'll go through the learning process of the CSS clip-path property to make some fantastic shapes with CSS.

To give you some more background: back in my day, when we worked on CSS, a lot of the shaping was done by overlaying elements and hiding them among other shapes above it.
The clip-path property existed but didn't have massive support back then.

That is, of course, changed, but my habits did not change, so let's refresh my brain ðŸ§  by exploring the CSS clip-path property.

## Understanding basic clipping with clip-path

Let's first look at the central concept of clipping.
We'll start by defining a sample box that is 200 by 200 pixels and has a background:

![Basic HTML structure](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626759308804/C_oBIKi45.png)

Nothing crazy yet, but let's see what happens when we add clip-path in the mix.

We'll put the clip-path on the box class, and we'll start by clipping a circle in the middle of our box.

![CSS Clip-path](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626759566473/tNjiB8iS9.png)

I've made the clipped piece less transparent for you to see, the actual clip-path only shows the circle bit, but this should give you an idea of the clipping.
It masks on top of an existing item.

## The shape of your "clip-path"

There are a couple of shapes we can use as clip paths. Let's have a look at those and how they work.

### Circle

The circle we have already seen in the basic example comes with the following syntax:

```css
circle(radius at posX posY)
```

The default position will be center, so we can also use a circle like this:

```css
clip-path: circle(50%);
```

This will make a circle that fills the whole box since the circle is half of the box.
And place it in the center by default.

However, we can offset the circle like this:

```css
clip-path: circle(50% at 70% 20%);
```

Which in turn, results in this:

![Offset mask](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1626759976640/lno0Cgyzs.png)

I've added the box as a transparent element so you can see what part is being clipped by our circle.

### Ellipse

A shape that works similarly is the ellipse, which has two values for the radius.

```css
ellipse(radiusX radiusY at posX posY)
```

To use it to clip our box:

```css
clip-path: ellipse(50% 25% at 50% 50%);
```

Resulting in a shape like such:

### Inset

Another great option is the inset value. This can be used to inset from the box bounding.

In basic it works like this:

```css
inset(top right bottom left round roundX roundY)
```

Let's try out a quite extreme issue to showcase what happens:

```css
clip-path: inset(10px 20px 30px 40px round 15px 50px);
```

Resulting in a shape like this:

### Polygon

The last one is super versatile. It's called the polygon and accepts pairs of x/y coordinates.
Making it possible to create impressive shapes with this.

The basic properties work like this:

```css
polygon(x1 y1, x2 y2, etc)
```

Let's make a star shape and see how that works:

```css
clip-path: polygon(
  50% 0%,
  61% 35%,
  98% 35%,
  68% 57%,
  79% 91%,
  50% 70%,
  21% 91%,
  32% 57%,
  2% 35%,
  39% 35%
);
```

Resulting in a star shape like this:

### SVG Paths

The last resource we can use is an SVG path. Yes, you heard that right.

Let's see how that works.

First, we'll need an HTML resource that has a [SVG clip path](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/svg-sprites/) definition:

```html
<svg class="svg">
  <clipPath id="triangle" clipPathUnits="objectBoundingBox">
    <path d="M0.05,0.05 h1 v1"></path>
  </clipPath>
</svg>
```

```css
clip-path: url(#triangle);
```

Resulting in a shape like this:

## Animating clip-paths

Another cool thing we can do is animate the clip-paths.

However, we can use these to animate our clip-paths, making sure they are compatible shapes.
For instance, when using a polygon, keep the same amount of points to animate with.

```css
@keyframes move {
  0% {
    clip-path: polygon(0 0, 50% 0, 100% 0, 100% 50%, 100% 100%, 50% 100%, 0 100%, 0 50%);
  }
  50% {
    clip-path: polygon(
      50% 50%,
      50% 25%,
      50% 50%,
      75% 50%,
      50% 50%,
      50% 75%,
      50% 50%,
      25% 50%
    );
  }
  100% {
    clip-path: polygon(0 0, 50% 0, 100% 0, 100% 50%, 100% 100%, 50% 100%, 0 100%, 0 50%);
  }
}
```

You can try this animate and all the other described properties on this Codepen.

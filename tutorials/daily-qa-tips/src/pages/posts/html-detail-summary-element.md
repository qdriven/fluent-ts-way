Today we will look at a native HTML element that can be used to create expandable elements.

It's the detail-summary combination, and the result will look like this.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rebelchris" data-slug-hash="abBYLrr" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="abBYLrr">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/rebelchris/pen/abBYLrr">
  abBYLrr</a> by Chris Bongers (<a href="https://codepen.io/rebelchris">@rebelchris</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async defer src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## HTML Detail summary

To add this functionality, we can enter a `details` element inside it with a `summary` which will act as the title; below that, a `p` will be the collapsable content.

It will look like this:

```html
<details>
  <summary>How old is Dragonball Z?</summary>
  <p>
    Dragon Ball Z is adapted from the final 324 chapters of the manga series,
    which were published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. It premiered
    in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989
  </p>
</details>
```

You can have multiple details on one page, and they are even styleable!

```css
details {
  width: 200px;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #efefef;
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
summary {
  color: #333;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

And that's it. We created a fantastic accordion-like element with no JavaScript involved!

## Browser support

The cool part about the detail and summary combi is that it has good support!
It's just IE not playing along.

Hey, you awesome developer, you want to get in on a secret of becoming even better?

Practice and learn! Today I'm going to challenge you to improve yourself; no matter what level you are, you can continually improve.

## 100daysofcode Challenge

One challenge which is absolute love, because of the community, is the #100daysofcode challenge.

You can find it here: [100daysofcode.com](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

Please sign up and start tweeting your progress.

Also, feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DailyDevTips1)!

## Why is a Challenge Good?

A challenge keeps you active, motivated, and accountable.
You can define what you are focussing on.
You can, for instance, do actual coding tests, but even reading up on things is good!

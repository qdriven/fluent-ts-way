And to be precise, from my past self.

As a gift to myself, I [wrote this letter precisely a year ago](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/a-letter-to-my-future-self/).
And boy, it put a smile on my face.

There were some things I could not have envisioned and some things I was right about.

## Reflection time

Let's go through this together, shall we?

... reading my letter ...

It's funny. I start with wanting to spend more time in nature, and I hope my past self is glad to hear we did spend a lot more time in nature and offline.

The big thing about the time when writing this letter was the travel bans; one year later, we still have a lot of travel bans in place.

But needless to say, I'm writing this today from a tropical island, on which, ironically enough, we got stuck ðŸ˜‚.

My wedding was the most beautiful day. It was exactly as I would have envisioned it, even better.
I did not only take three days off but a whole ten days, and it was worth it.

I am happy to inform you that besides those ten days, I did not miss a day in blogging.

I'm super happy that I wrote this letter to myself. Reading my predictions and reflecting on the past year was super fun.

## Keeping the tradition in honor

That said, let's write a letter to Chris from the future, to be precise, 2023, Chris.

Hey Chris,

This is you, but the one a year younger.
You might even remember us reading a letter, deciding to write one, and re-reading this one now.

Another crazy year has gone by. Traveling is still a pain, but hopefully, you and your beautiful wife have finally been able to visit Europe and your family.

I know everyone was eagerly waiting to host you in The Netherlands finally.

And perhaps you even found the perfect place to stay for a more extended period.

As for work, the job is still treating you well. I see you've grown so much in a year, though. Impressive to know where you are now and how confident you are about it.

I'm also delighted to see you've been keeping up the exercise and outdoor adventures.
It must mean we love the outdoors, right.

Let's take about the blog for a second. This is like your baby at this point. It's been almost three years since you started it, and you did a full unbroken year of blogging.

Most people would say that that's nuts but look at the number of people you have inspired, helped, and guided in those three years.

Worth it!
Keep doing what you love.

I hope this letter put another smile on your face, and you will keep this tradition in honor.

Cheers,

Chris ðŸ’–

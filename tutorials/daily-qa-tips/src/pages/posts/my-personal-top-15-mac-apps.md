Today we'll be looking at my personal top 15 Mac apps.
I'm quite a minimalist in installing and keeping apps, so these 15 are the only "extra" apps I use on my device.

My profile:

- Developer
- Multi-device user
- Blogger

Let's get started with the list.

## 1. 1Password

![1Password for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778580843/3mRNeUiTt.png)

I literally can't live without 1Password. We developers tend to make the most awful and bad passwords ourselves. So 1Password is to the rescue for generating and managing this for us.

[Install 1Password](https://1password.com/)

## 2. Google Chrome

![Google Chrome for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778628813/aZHGT1Nbf.png)

Jeez, Chrome should be pre-installed. It's the first app I install on my brand-new machine!
I Can't do my job the same without it.

[Install Chrome for Mac](https://www.google.com/intl/nl/chrome/)

## 3. Spotify

![Spotify for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778697320/JSg-NHnY6.png)

As a developer and writer, getting in the zone is essential.
What best to do so than Spotify?
Listen to an excellent podcast or epic playlist.

[Install Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/)

## 4. Spark

![Spark for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778743810/GCwHbYHbi.png)

I use Gmail for most of my email addresses, and Spark is just amazing in keeping track of all of these in one maintainable inbox.
It's a big advocate for [inbox zero](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/a-clear-mind-starts-with-a-clear-inbox/), just like me.

[Install Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)

## 5. Visual Studio Code

![Visual Studio Code for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778813555/A6-g6GKTk.png)

I went from Dreamweaver to Atom to JetBrains to Visual Studio Code, and I have zero regrets! It's just fantastic software!
For me, visual Studio Code is the only suitable product for Mac Microsoft.

> Note: I switched to [WebStorm](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/i-stopped-using-visual-studio-code/)

[Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## 6. iTerm2

![iTerm2 for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778872857/rGDp_0A8V.png)

The default terminal for Mac is not bad, but once you go iTerm2 you can't go back. It's just packed with all those little extras you'll ever need!

[Install iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

## 7. Cyberduck

![Cyberduck for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600778936079/qbbeVAJqT.png)

FTP might be a bit old-school, but now and then, we need it. Cyberduck is fantastic and clean, way better than FileZilla.

[Install Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/download/)

## 8. Postman

![Postman for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779097878/Kc9Jqcs3k.png)

I switch between Postman and Insomnia, but Postman is cool because it collaborates well for teams. You can test your APIs and keep track of them. I love their environment setups.

[Install Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

## 9. RunJs

![RunJs for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779159144/mDSkFvM2B.png)

Ever needed to run just a tiny JavaScript snippet and too lazy to open a project or Codepen. This little app does just that for you.

[Install RunJs](https://runjs.dev/)

## 10. Notion

![Notion for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779254236/Br3GysJ2-.png)

When it comes to writing and keeping track of my projects, Notion helps me a lot. It's the best note-keeping and project-management tool I've ever seen.

[Install Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop)

## 11. Grammarly

![Grammarly for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779355696/rwJKEM4zz.png)

English is not my native tongue, so Grammarly helps me make sense of my writing. And it's good at picking up nuances in my texts.

[Install Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/native/mac)

## 12. iA Writer

![iA Writer for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779393395/kb3SmXO3G.png)

My blog is written in Markdown, and I use iA Writer to track my blog articles' cross-devices. I start items on my Mac and sometimes swap to my iPad or phone to finish them.

[Install iA Writer](https://ia.net/downloads)

## 13. Sketch

![Sketch for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779445464/pds8VJrpq.png)

Sketch is not my golden go-to, but I paid for and use it for all my design stuff. Making banners, designs, and cropping images.

[Install Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/for-designers/)

## 14. Loom

![Loom for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779479467/u2eDAm46z.png)

Did you ever need to do a quick review or feedback visually?
Loom is your guy! It's amazingly quick and fast to record a session.

[Install Loom](https://www.loom.com/desktop)

## 15. OBS

![OBS for Mac](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600779541957/yuLqs2HNd.png)

If Loom is insufficient, you can always go to OBS, a fantastic tool to capture all kinds of screen recordings.
It works super well and has so many options that it scares me sometimes.

[Install OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)

We've been building quite a lot of things around the medusa webshop.
However, I'm writing these articles day-by-day, and luckily the medusa team has been super helpful with sorting some things out as I hit them.

But I finally hit a point where I must invest more time before writing them.
So, for now, the webshop articles will be on a short halt. I plan to create some more research-intensive things in the background and get back to you with some articles on them.

## What to expect

Some things that we still need to look into are:

- Generic webshop setup (which I won't bore you with)
- Custom payment provider (mollie)
- Custom shipment provider (via Post NL)
- Custom attributes to products
- Sync with PayPal Zettle
- Import via CSV
- Retrieve data from external API about products

This is quite the list, and all of them need quite a lot of research from my end before we can do them.

If you love this webshop series, subscribe to my newsletter and keep up to date with all the articles I push out.

## What's upcoming next?

You might be wondering, what can we expect in the meantime then?

I have some CSS and JavaScript things that have been added to my backlog, which I'd love to dive into.
I also plan to write an entire series on creating a portfolio from scratch, which might be a fun experience for people following.

And like always, if there are specific topics you'd like to know more about: Send me an email or Twitter DM.

I'm always happy to adjust articles to what people want to learn.

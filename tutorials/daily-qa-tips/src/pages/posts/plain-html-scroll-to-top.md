The other day, I posted a [`JavaScript` Scroll to Top](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/vanilla-javascript-scroll-to-top/) function that is very cool. As mentioned, there are so many ways of doing a particular action.

On this specific post, I got a lot of comments; you can do the same in just plain `HTML`. This is true! And I thought it would be great to write an article about this.

## HTML Structure

```html
<div id="top"></div>
<a href="#top" class="scroll scroll-top">‚òùÔ∏è</a>
<a href="#bottom" class="scroll scroll-bottom">üëá</a>
<div class="content">All the content...</div>
<div id="bottom"></div>
```

So the things to mark are the divs with specific IDs. We just made two empty divs, but we can even use existing divs!

Then we create two links with a `href` to `#top` (id="top") and `#bottom` (id="bottom")

This will automatically scroll to the specific ID once clicked on!

To make it smooth, we can add the following `CSS`.

```css
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

It can be as easy as this, with many ways leading to the same solution. It all depends on what you prefer or need.

See it in action on this Codepen.

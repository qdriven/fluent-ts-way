I love to speak about my profession. I'm passionate about it, and it feels liberating to be fortunate to talk about it with great people.

Since starting my blogging journey, I've been on a few talks and love to share these fantastic talks with you.

Public talking is a liberator. It comes down to expressing your thoughts on topics, but not one-sided. It's often a two-way communication going on.

The are multiple ways of public talking. For this article, I'll drop the talks I've done: podcasts and a Bootcamp.

## JS Bits

The first talk I've ever done was with [Bill Coloe](https://twitter.com/Cilly_Boloe). Thanks again, Bill!

Bill is also a developer at heart, and he asked me for a general interview.
Of course, that's something I'm interested in.

We talk about Blogging, JavaScript, and 3rd party tracking in this interview.

You can check out the full interview here:

## Hexdevs Podcast

The second public talk was with the Hexdevs podcast hosted by [Stefanni Brasil](https://twitter.com/stefannibrasil) and [Thiago Araujo](https://twitter.com/thdaraujo).

I've met Stefanni and Thiago through the [Blogging for devs community](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) by [Monica Lent](https://twitter.com/monicalent).

And Stefanni reached out to me to talk about learning in public. This was around the time I was trying out my Twitch and Youtube live streams when writing in public.

We talk about how I got into Blogging, how I wrote many articles, and which ones are the most popular.

You can check this episode here.

## Hashnode Bootcamp

After this, I got asked by Hashnode to be a speaker at their Bootcamp.
I attended the first Bootcamp, so to be asked as a speaker myself was super cool!

During this talk, I've focused on: Why should every developer blog? What are the best ways to start a blog in 2020?

Which was a perfect fit since that was exactly what I did!

You can find the talk here:

## Frontend Greatness

And the latest podcast I was asked for is [Frontend Greatness](https://twitter.com/FrontendGr8ness) by [A-P Koponen](https://twitter.com/APKoponen).

A-P also found me through the [Blogging for devs community](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) and reached out to talk about a Peers.

This is an exciting topic for me, so I immediately said Yes, having peers is super important. In this podcast, you'll hear our shared opinions on this topic.

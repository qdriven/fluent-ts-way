Regarding Terminals, our developers are susceptible. We love our terminal as it's our home base.

So whenever a new terminal pops up, I have to try it at least.

I love and use iTerm2 for almost everything. But Warp is the new kid on the block, and although it comes with some downsides, it's pretty slick!

## The good

This new terminal is made from scratch, not based on what we already know about terminals.

This, to me, is what makes it so cool. The whole terminal experience changes and makes it feel like a native app.

It's super quick to autocomplete and separate commands, so it's easy to understand which output belongs to which command.

Besides these apparent wins, it's also super fast and comes with Intellisense for npm and git. You'll never forget a command this way.

## The bad

To be honest, there are always downsides, aren't there.

It's only available for Mac, but the team seems to be working hard on a Windows and Linux version.

It's not open source, this might not be a bad hard point, but for some people, that's a deal-breaker.
No concrete business model so far, so that brings us to the ugly.

## The ugly

You need to log in, which seems weird to use a terminal.
I'm not sure about the side effects of this, but it might come with its downsides later on.

I hope they are not using this personal data to keep track of our terminal usage, as it's now connected to a user profile.

## Conclusion

Worth a try if you're on Mac. It's pretty awesome to use.
At this point, I'm unsure about the business model or ethics of why a login is needed. Let's see if this clears up in the future.

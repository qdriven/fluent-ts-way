Hey guys,

Not the be lazy, but this is such an amazing content library I just had to share it with you!

Microsoft wrote a complete article set on Node.js, and it's really good.

As a developer, you can help people so far, but companies like Microsoft have way more budget to write and make demo's for us, so let's all take advantage of it.

The best part: It's Free! ðŸ’¸

What you'll learn:

- Node.js basics
- Starting our first Node project
- Debugging Node.js
- Visual Studio tips
- Building an API

As mentioned, that is golden content right there!

You can find these docs here:
